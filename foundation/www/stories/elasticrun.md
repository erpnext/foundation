### How did you discover ERPNext?

While searching for OpenSource ERP packages on Google.

Seemed very simple, neat and consistent UI in the beginning. As we deep dived, we found the framework underneath to be even better and the customisation options were very neatly modelled in the entire package.

### Share some insights from your implementation process. How did you manage the change process?

We are using ERPNext for our in house business processes and accounting. We started off very small, with very basic features like Employee details, leave applications and expense claim. As our expertise and confidence in ERPNext grew we rolled out Supplier, Purchase, accounting modules also.

### What modules did you end up using? And how?

HR, Buying, Accounting, Sales are the key modules are using right now. As stated above, we started off small with HR modules and gradually added workflows and transactions for other internal business processes.

Also, we are in the process of exploring Frappe framework as a rapid application development framework.
