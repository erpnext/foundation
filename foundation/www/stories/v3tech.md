#### How did you discover ERPNext?

We were advised by Grynn GmbH to implement a business management solution in order to gain control of finances and follow a path towards profitability.

#### Why did you choose to implement an ERP system?

You can't improve, what you cannot measure.

We operate in highly competitive market with new entrants using pricing strategy to gain market share. And we almost fell into that trap of pricing to the bottom by competing with them for the same work. Luckily we started to track our wins and losses via the CRM system and we worked out where our strengths were. Our price reflected high end design and reliable service for aerospace and transport industries.

Thanks to this insight, we brought back focus to hi-end engineering work  and kept differentiating from our low cost competitors. Now, none of our customers will ever switch for reason of price. Because they know we deliver reliably when it comes to complexity &
service. Thanks to ERPNext, we are able to price our value in the market.
