## Asset Value Adjustment

In case of fixed asset managment, sometimes the value of an asset needs some adjustment. For example, if a laptop got damaged some reason, and it's value will be dropped instantly. And in that case, we have to readjust the value of the asset.

Using Asset Value Adjustment form, you can do that easily. In the transaction, select the asset and mention the current value. And the system will book a "Gain/Loss on asset revaluation" and adjust the valuation of the asset.
