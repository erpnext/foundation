# Leaves and Holiday

This section will help you understand how ERPNext enables you to efficiently manage the leave schedule of your organization. It also explains the way employees can apply for leaves.

Employees create leave requests, which their respective managers (leave approver) can approve or reject. An Employee can select from a number of leave types such as sick leave, casual leave, privilege leave and so on. The number and type of leaves an Employee can apply is controlled by Leave Allocations. You can create Leave Allocations for a Leave Period based on the company's Leave Policy. You can also allocate additional leaves to your employees and generate reports to track leaves taken by Employees.
