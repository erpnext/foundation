# Healthcare Service Unit

ERPNext Healthcare helps you map your facility infrastructure and manage scheduling, billing etc. A Healthcare Service Unit corresponds to each such unit which can be scheduled so that these are made available for Appointment booking or Inpatient occupancy and also to be billed. You can create Healthcare Service Units by going to,

`Healthcare > Masters > Healthcare Service Unit`

It is also possible that you can group and organize all the service units in a hierarchical fashion.
