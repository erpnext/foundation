# Sales Analytics Report

With the ability to see and analyze your sales data in different views, data is able to diagnose and analyze to better understand how sales are performing.  The data allows for filters to be altered dynamically with criteria selections through filters. There are three window areas that make up the Sales Analytics Report.  The Filter Toolbar Window, the Graph Window and the Data Window.  Please see the example below.

### The Filter Toolbar Window

The toolbar provides for filtering to select what data is to be used. Using the dropdown selections, data selections can be refined in a compounding fashion. As the selections are made, data is reflected in the data window as well as the graph window.

### Data Analytics and Charts

Within the data window, selections can be made to expand or compress the data to be analyzed.  At the left of the window, (blue), are selection boxes. Each box can be selected for use. There is no restriction for the data comparison, so a higher level can be compared to lower levels.  The data column to the right, (orange), contains selection boxes with + and minus selections. Selecting a + will expand the data and selecting a – will compress the data. As this is performed, the Graph Window is dynamically altered allowing rapid data analysis.
