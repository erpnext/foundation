# Request for Raw Materials from Sales Order

Production Plan helps user to plan production against multiple sales orders and helps in Material Procurement planning for the raw-material item, based on the quantity of finished product to be manufactured.

But, when you only need to plan for raw-material items of a single Sales Order, it becomes a bit of a tedious task. Hence, you can create a Material Request for the raw materials of the finished Items present in the Sales Order, from that Sales Order itself.

To do so, you can follow the below steps.

* After your Sales Order has been submitted, click on **Make** and select **Request for Raw Materials**.

* Here, you can change the BOM as you want and choose the necessary options.

Suppose, enabling the **Include Exploded Items** will fetch the Raw Materials from the Exploded Items of BOM and enabling the **Ignore Existing Ordered Qty** will make a Request even if the required quantities are present.

* Click on Make, and your Material Request will be submitted.
