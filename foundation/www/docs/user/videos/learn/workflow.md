By default, ERPNext has a two level verification system for documents, Save and Submit. If you have more than one authority approving a document, you can manage it via Workflow. Workflow allows you to define multiple stages for the document to be reviewed and finally get approved. It also allows you to designate who will be the approver at each stage.
