<h4>2. I want to sell ERPNext Service to my customers. How can I do that?</h4>

<p>Before you sell anything to anyone, you must be completely convinced that it is the right tool for you to promote. After all, it is your reputation at stake. Before you sell any ERPNext service, we recommend that you evaluate ERPNext very minutely yourself and the best way to do it is self-implementation. Start using ERPNext for billing, customer support, CRM, quoting your customers. Even if you don't wish to use it in production, use it as a test. Once, and if, you are convinced of the application, you should demo it to your customers. Nothing sells better than confidence, so its best to be confident before you sell.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Disclosure: We use ERPNext extensively in our own organization too!</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>6. As a service provider how do I make money?</h4>

<p>With ERPNext compared to other ERPs, the cost of license is zero, so there is more money on the table to ensure a successful ERP implementations. These savings can be effectively used to tailor the ERPNext system to the user's requirements and / or to enhance the ERPNext product itself by adding features that could be sponsored. There is always the usual revenue model for:</p>

<ol>
<li>Implementation Services: Gap analysis, user training, data importing</li>

<li>Integration: Integrating with other applications using the API</li>

<li>Print Formats and Reports: Customized Print Layouts and Reports</li>

<li>Website and Webshop setup: Customizing and setting up the website and webshop via ERPNext</li>

<li>Support: Priority phone, in-person support as needed</li>

<li>Maintenance: Support for patches and upgrades</li>

<li>Hosting: Providing hosting services</li>

<h4>7. What is the general sales / implementation process for ERPNext</h4>

<ol>
<li>Ideally, you must first introduce the product and give a quick demo. It is best to highlight that the product is in use in over 1000 organizations across 130+ countries and is also affordable and Open Source.</li>

<li>If the customer is convinced, you can do a pilot order in a new trial or Virtual Machine so that the customer is able to see her own data in the system.</li>

<li>If the customer is willing to go ahead for implementation, you must identify a project champion within the organization.</li>

<li>With the project champion, you can start migrating the master data (Items, Customer, Supplier) from the existing system into ERPNext.</li>

<li>Before going live, it is best to do a few test orders through the system and check if there is any customization that is needed for the customer's process.</li>

<li>Finally before going live, accounting and inventory opening data should be setup and with the help of the champion.</li>

<li>If the customer requires the website to be from ERPNext, you will need to help the customer to create content and setup their master data.</li>

<h4>9. How do I contribute back to ERPNext</h4>

<p>ERPNext is built as a community product with the help of hundreds on end users and developers. If you face a problem with ERPNext or have a suggetion for a feature, you should plan on having the feature contributed back to ERPNext. Unlike other "open core" projects, ERPNext does not encourage 3rd party apps, which ultimately lead to a bad user experience and usually leave the end-user hostage to a service provider and in many cases saddled with a bad solution.</p>

<p>If you want to propose an enhancement, you must first send a proposal. Once it is okayed by any maintainer, you can start development according to the contribution guidelines and send a pull request to the core product. <a href="https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/wiki/Contribution-Guidelines">Read the contribution guidelines for more details</a></p>
